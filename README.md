## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Most of my aquired knowledge in this project is in CSS, since there wasn't that much HTML to work with and it was pretty simple.

I've used transitions for the first time, 
I've learnt how to do a color overlay and opacity on an image upon hovering over it.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's CSS card video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEq5cWNYt8) - I highly recommend this video, because it has a similar topic and everything is explained very well.
